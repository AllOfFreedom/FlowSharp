# What's not implemented:
Please contribute to working on this list!
*Shape text:
  * Currently only centered in the shape.
  * Boundaries can be easily exceeded.
  * No justification.
  * Single line only - no auto-wrap.
* Multiple element select.
  * With click-drag selection rectangle.
  * Scrollbars for canvas - currently you drag the canvas to move it.
* Zoom.
* Shape rotation.
* Custom defined connection points.
  * Including on connectors.
* Adjust custom connection points intelligently when shape is resized.
* True dynamic connectors.
* Other line caps besides an arrow.
* Ruler margins / page boundaries.
* Snap shapes to centers and edges.
* Printing (more or less easily implemented, actually)  If you want to print, save the diagram as a PNG and use some other tool!
* True drag-from-toolbox-onto-surface.
* Arrow cursors for grip dragging.
* Undo/redo.  That'll be fun!
* Better property UX - PropertyGrid's are ok for developers, they are awful for users.
